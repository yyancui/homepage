I am currently a visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Reed College. Before coming here, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alberta and the University of Toronto. I completed my Ph.D. degree from School of Mathematics at Jilin University in December 2020.
