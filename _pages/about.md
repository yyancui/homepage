I am currently a visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.reed.edu/math/) at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/). Before coming here, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) and the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I completed my Ph.D. degree from [School of Mathematics](https://math.jlu.edu.cn/) at [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) in December 2020.
